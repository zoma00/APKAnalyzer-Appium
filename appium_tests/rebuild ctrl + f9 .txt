If you can't find the "Rebuild Project" option in Android Studio, follow these steps:

1. **Build Menu**: Go to the top menu bar and click on `Build`. 
2. **Look for Rebuild**: In the dropdown, you should see options like `Make Project` and `Rebuild Project`. If you only see `Make Project`, it might be because your project is already built and doesn't need rebuilding.

3. **Alternative Method**: You can also use the shortcut:
   - Press `Ctrl + F9` (Windows/Linux) or `Command + F9` (Mac) to build the project.

4. **Invalidate Caches/Restart**: If you still can't find it, try going to `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart...` and then restart Android Studio. This can resolve UI issues.

After rebuilding, check the output directory again for your APK. Let me know if you need further assistance!
